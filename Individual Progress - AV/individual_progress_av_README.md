    * Back of the car that shows the taillight and license plate
  * Overhead shots of parked cars in the garage

# Completed
* Took pictures of different types of scenarios in parking garages
* Researched deep learning models

# In Progress
* Take more pictures for data depending on the updated code
* Research more on object detection, machine learning, and deep learning models
