File named "Team13CMPE181Project" 

Worked on the ML for the project 

Followed: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2.md 

# Steps 
- Figured that the main part of the smart parking would be object detection and identifying the cars in the parking lot. 
- Researched different ML methods to use and open source code for object detection. 
- Found the github from tensorflow models and started browsing. <https://github.com/tensorflow/models>
- Following the github and the different blogs to get basic object detection of cars

# Completed 
- First part of the ML detection to recognize the cars in the parking lot photo.

# In Progress
- Testing the current code and future code on photos provided by team member
- code to check lot for open spaces 
- counting/identifying number of cars that enter and leave
