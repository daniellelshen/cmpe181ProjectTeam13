# Individual Progress - Aman Kaur

# **Steps**
- One of the main aspects of this application involves using a google maps api and integrating it into our design. To achieve and integrate google maps in the API, background research to learn how to use google maps API.
- Another area of research to cover in regards to the API is how to integrate the UI with the backend server.

# **Research**
- To embedd google maps into a basic web application, a basic HTTP request with an iframe generator may be used. Using this guide, an example was made to create an interactive map around SJSU was created in the attached 'index.html' file. Inside the iframe request, an API key needs to generated to use Google Maps Platform. 

  
- In terms of integrating the user interface with the backend server of this application, there are several optionn considered:
   -  User Interface : React
   -  Backend Server : Google Cloud
   -  Client SDK     : Firebase
  
# **Plan**
- Continue research & API implementation of UI to Backend
- Learn how to use statellite & Google Maps to pin parking garage locations
